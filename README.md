## Web Development- Course Description (2018-2019 T1-T2 class)

This class will introduce you to the wide world of Web development, with a particular focus on mobile devices. Students learn how to design and build a website using HTML + CSS + Bootstrap and build responsive web sites suitable for all devices. 
 
This class is a combination of a web-based curriculum that students use to learn the core concepts and to practice these skills doing assignments, as well as a live environment, a cloud-based web server.  Students are given a space on the web server and learn a whole host of development skills while creating their final project, building a responsive website from scratch. You can see more about the requirements for this web page on the [class webpage on GitHub](https://github.com/lrei-coding/web-design_18-19).
 
Students learn about the mechanics of web servers and hosting, how collaboration is done using Git, building to spec, and of course the coding skills to actuallly complete their project.

Student use their skills to build their individual website projects hosted in the server space allocated to them.
 
Additionally, this class has other activities and challenges where the students practice working together on web projects. Towards the end of Trimester 1, students were split into teams and were tasked to build a group website as well as to break the other teams website, and then regroup and repair their own broken sites. More details about the group challenge [can be found here](https://github.com/lrei-coding/web-design_18-19/blob/master/Group-Challenges/red-vs-blue_webdesign.md).
