# Website Project: Personal Web Site

Create a website of your choosing with Responsive Web Design using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap skills you've learned.
- Build the site using [**CodeAnywhere**](https://codeanywhere.com/)

## Website Requirements

- Site needs to have multiple HTML pages, with links to the other pages on each page. (via **Navbar**, see **Bootstrap** section)
- Single CSS page that is used for all HTML pages
- One **Html** page should be titled **about** and include 3 or more short paragraphs about the person who created the site and what the site is about.
- See list below of requirements for **HTML** tags and **CSS** rule-sets as well as **Bootstrap** requirements

## HTML requirements

- Create an **images** folder in your shell account you access via **CodeAnywhere** and store all the image files there.You will need to use **relative paths** for all **but one image**
- Use an **absolute path** for one image 
- Use of `<div>` and `<span>` elements in the 3 text paragraphs, with styling defined in CSS
- Use a minimum of 5 HTML Tags **inline,** in your HTML files. These tags should work independent of the CSS file (e.g. `<bold>test</bold>`)
- Use **HTML Comment Tags** to describe each part of the site and explain your work

## CSS requirements

- Background color
- Image size
- H1 styling
- Include `id`, `class`, and `tag` selectors in your CSS file
- Use at least one example where you **combine** multiple CSS selectors
- Use of an **Image animation** filter or something similar
- Use **CSS Comments** to describe and explain your work

## Bootstrap requirements

- You will need to link to the bootstrap CDN in the `<head>` portion of the .html file (think CSS)
- use of **container** or **container-fluid** tag
- use of **jumbotron** class
- use at least 4 `row` divs
- use a multi-column layout in a way that the page renders differntly for smaller and larger devices (e.g. by using `col-sm-6` and `col-md-4`)
- have content across at least 2 `columns` for displays larger than an iPhone (375 pixels and above)

## Bonus

- Have the description of an image apear only when you **hover** over the image, but hidden all other times.
- Use of **Button Groups** - Have buttons aligned and stretch across the entire width of screen
- Use of **Sticky Navbar** - So the Navbar remains visible as you scroll down the page
- Custom color for the **Navbar**
- Create a **carousel** or **table** using bootstrap
