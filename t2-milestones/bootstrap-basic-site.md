Create or update your personal site so that it contains a basic Bootstrap v4 environment.

## Website Requirements

- Site should be:
-- responsive
-- Viewport set to zoom to max-width on all devices
-- contain links to Bootstrap and jQuery dependencies in the <head>

## Bootstrap requirements
**Bootstrap links via CDN**
Add the links to your .html page per these intructions:  
``` https://github.com/lrei-coding/web-design_18-19/blob/master/bootstrap-cdn.md ```

**Viewport**
To keep the zoom level set to page width on smaller devices, even with Bootstrap, best to use the following code:  
```<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">```

**Jumbotron**  
```https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/```

**Cards**  
```https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/```

## CSS requirements
Any of these elements can be used
- Background color
- Image size

## Bonus
Use CSS override on Bootstrap elements (e.g. background-image for Jumbotron)
