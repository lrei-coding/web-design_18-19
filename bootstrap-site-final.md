## Website Requirements

- Single CSS page that is used for all HTML pages
- contain links to CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery dependencies in the <head> 
- One **Html** page should be titled **about** and include 3 or more short paragraphs about the person who created the site and what the site is about.
- Site should be:
  - responsive
  - Viewport set to zoom to max-width on all devices

## CSS requirements
Any of these elements can be used

## Bootstrap requirements
**Bootstrap links via CDN**  
Add the links to your .html page per these intructions:  
``` https://github.com/lrei-coding/web-design_18-19/blob/master/bootstrap-cdn.md ```

**Container**  
Make sure you include all your bootstrap code in a *container*, as such:  
```
<div class="container">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
**Viewport**  
To keep the zoom level set to page width on smaller devices, even with Bootstrap, best to use the following code:  
```<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">```

A mix of any of these elements:

- [**Buttons**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/)
