# Website Challenge  

The class will be divided into 2 teams, a Blue team  and a Red team.

### Blue Team
This team will be given a set amount of time to work together to come up with an idea for a website they can all build together. Some will focus on the idea, others will focus on the HTML layout, others will focus on the design aesthetic using CSS, and some will make sure all the elements are well documented in the code. This website will follow the design criteria of the [Individual website project](https://github.com/lrei-coding/web-design_18-19/blob/master/t1_assignment.md).  

### Red Team
This team will be given a set amount of time to work together to critique, pick apart, and disable the Blue team's site, using only read/write access to the source code on the web server. Attacks on the site are limited to one-off changes on the source code, per element.  

The Blue team will be given a chance to fix their site. When the time is up, site will be evaluated to see how functional it is.  

Once completed, teams will switch colors and roles.

Each team will create and present an HTML report of what actions they took they did to disable the other team's site.

Teams will be assigned a score based on agreed upon criteria. Team with the highest score wins.
